                <h2>The Loyal Friend</h2>
                <p><b>Ron Weasley</b> is Harry Potter's first friend in the wizarding world and remains one of his closest companions throughout their adventures. As a pure-blood wizard from the large, loving, and often chaotic Weasley family, Ron brings warmth, humor, and a strong sense of loyalty to the trio.</p>
                <p>Despite often feeling overshadowed by his famous best friend and highly intelligent girlfriend, Ron proves his bravery and resourcefulness time and again. His strategic thinking, especially in wizard's chess, and his unwavering support are crucial to overcoming the many dangers they face.</p>
